# Why am I taking this course?

Write why you want to complete this, why you must complete this.

To be honest, be more specific.

- I want a better life for my family.
  - My future wife, my parents, my grandparents, and my brothers.
  - I want to build a better life for the people I love, the people that matter to me â€” my future wife, my parents, my grandparents, and my brothers. They mean the world to me, and I want to make them proud.
- I want to get a better job.
- I want to make a bunch of money.
  - I want to have a $100k salary in 2 years.
- I want to be a part of the history in this amazing blockchain industry.

If you don't finish this course, if you continue on the pattern of life where you're currently on, if you don't get better, if you don't make yourself better, make this list of reasons, save it here. And every time this course gets hard, and anytime anything gets hard in life, come back to this list of reasons. And maybe every six months to a year to two years, come back and update this list of reasons. Why are you doing what you're currently doing?
